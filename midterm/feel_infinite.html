<h1>Feel Infinite</h1>
<p>Feel Infinite is a record about the utopian idea of club culture &ndash; music about the club, as well as for the club in and of itself.</p>

<p>The essence of the record is to draw emotions and moments that above all, feel human within the context of dance music.</p>
<p>I want it to be celebratory of all that we feel and do and experience &ndash; the beautiful, the good, and the bad.</p>

<h2>Influences</h2>
<p>From the first deep breaths of opener &quot;Fall&quot; to the warbled wobble of &quot;Afterglow,&quot; voices set the emotional tone for the entire album. Aubin-Dionne is gifted at chopping up R&amp;B vocals on top of dancefloor thumpers, and more than ever, he seems to be aware of its emotional impact. Feel Infinite is an openly tender album, meant to evoke the liberation of sharing music in a communal space even as you listen at home, alone, with headphones.</p>

<p>Hearing Phil discuss the utopian optimistic nature of the record, I wanted to step out of my comfort zone a bit &ndash; my typical sort of dark, subverted nuance was possibly too cold or even esoteric, especially hearing the music (which is lush and gorgeous), so I focused heavily on communicating that optimism through colours and movement. It was a good challenge.</p>

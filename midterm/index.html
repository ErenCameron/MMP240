  <h3>Earnest, Emotional, Dance Music</h3>
  <p>&quot;I imagine there&apos;s some cool grey scale techno guys who think my music is just melodramatic soap opera shit, but I kinda fuck with that, and I stand by it&quot;.</p>

  <h4>Influences</h4>
  <h5>Montreal</h5>
   <div class="montreal">
    <img src="midterm-images/montreal.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>&quot;Montreal remains a driving force and inspiration behind everything I do. Part of it is a certain feeling of being a misfit or slightly left-field. From our rock bands to rap producers, to even the French-Canadian filmmakers working in Hollywood, like Denis Villeneuve, I think we end up in this place where no matter how much we might work within greater systems or scenes, our output always remains somewhat peculiar and (hopefully) rarely gets lost in the sauce&quot;.</p>

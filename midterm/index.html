<h3>Earnest, Emotional, Dance Music</h3>
<p>&quot;I imagine there&apos;s some cool grey scale techno guys who think my music is just melodramatic soap opera shit, but I kinda fuck with that, and I stand by it&quot;.</p>

<h4>Influences</h4>
<h5>Montreal</h5>
<p>&quot;Montreal remains a driving force and inspiration behind everything I do. Part of it is a certain feeling of being a misfit or slightly left-field. From our rock bands to rap producers, to even the French-Canadian filmmakers working in Hollywood, like Denis Villeneuve, I think we end up in this place where no matter how much we might work within greater systems or scenes, our output always remains somewhat peculiar and (hopefully) rarely gets lost in the sauce&quot;.</p>
<h6>R&amp;B</h6>
<p>&quot;R&amp;B vocals are my gospel or disco &ndash; that&apos;s what I heard in the halls of high school every day &ndash; and then I throw through a club music structure. But there&apos;s also this side of me that's tied to Montreal music: the biggest things in my city were early Arcade Fire and Godpseed! You Black Emperor; very melodic, intense, melodramatic stuff&quot;.</p>

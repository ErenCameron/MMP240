            <p>Fast breaks. Lay ups. With Mercury's
            Insignia on our sneakers,
            We outmaneuvered the footwork
            Of bad angels. Nothing but a hot
            Swish of strings like silk
            Ten feet out. In the roundhouse
            Labyrinth our bodies
            Created, we could almost
            Last forever, poised in midair
            Like storybook sea monsters.
            A high note hung there
            A long second. Off
            The rim. We'd corkscrew
            Up &amp; dunk balls that exploded
            The skullcap of hope &amp; good
            Intention. Lanky, all hands
            &amp; feet...sprung rhythm.
            We were metaphysical when girls
            Cheered on the sidelines.
            Tangled up in a falling,
            Muscles were a bright motor
            Double-flashing to the metal hoop
            Nailed to our oak.
            When Sonny Boy's mama died
            He played nonstop all day, so hard
            Our backboard splintered.
            Glistening with sweat,
            We rolled the ball off
            Our fingertips. Trouble
            Was there slapping a blackjack
            Against an open palm.
            Dribble, drive to the inside,
            &amp; glide like a sparrow hawk.
            Lay ups. Fast breaks.
            We had moves we didn't know
            We had. Our bodies spun
            On swivels of bone &amp; faith,
            Through a lyric slipknot
            Of joy, &amp; we knew we were
            Beautiful &amp; dangerous.</p>

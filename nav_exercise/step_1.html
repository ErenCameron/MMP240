<h1>The Crust</h1>
<h2>(Food Processor/Pastry Blender Required)</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<section>Combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt and stir to mix completely. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch cubes and separate the cubes and mix them into the dry ingredients. Place the mixture with the butter into your food processor and pulse until the butter is about pea sized. Make sure the butter is evenly blended into the mixture. While blending slowly pour your ice water into the mixture so that it is incorporated.</section>
<h4>2.</h4>
<section>Pull the dough out and cut it in half and form two discs about 2 inches thick. Refridgerate the discs for about 2 hours or overnight and then roll them into a 9 inch circular crust. Place the crusts into a pie tin and fill with dry beans and bake in the oven at 350 for about 25 minutes. While they are baking we can make the filling.</section>
